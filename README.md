## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment of a given text. In this notebook, we employ the LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to perform sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the experiment, you will be able to:

- Explore the text data
- Understand and perform text pre-processing
- Build an LSTM model
- Train the model on the IMDB reviews dataset

## Usage

### 1. Running the Notebook Locally

To run the notebook locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM-Model.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```
    cd Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM-Model
    ```

3. Open the notebook file `Sentiment_Analysis_using_LSTM_Model.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Execute the notebook cells one by one to explore the dataset, perform text pre-processing, build the LSTM model, and train the model on the IMDB reviews dataset.

### 2. Running the Notebook on Google Colab

You can also run the notebook directly in your browser using Google Colab. Click the "Open in Colab" badge above, and it will open the notebook in Colab. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and perform the analysis.
